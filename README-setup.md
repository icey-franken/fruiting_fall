# Flask React Project

This is the backend for the Flask React project.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev -r dev-requirements.txt --python=python3 && pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment
4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file

5. Get into your pipenv, seed your database, and run your flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   python -m database && flask run
   ```
6. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./client/README.md) inside the client directory.




***
*IMPORTANT!*
   If you add any python dependencies to your pipfiles, you'll need to regenerate your requirements.txt before deployment.
   You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
   ```

*ALSO IMPORTANT!*
   psycopg2-binary MUST remain a dev dependency because you can't install it on apline-linux.
   There is a layer in the Dockerfile that will install psycopg2 (not binary) for us.

## Deploy to Heroku

1. Create a new project on Heroku
2. Under Resources click "Find more add-ons" and add the add on called "Heroku Postgres"
3. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line)
4. Run
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
5. Login to the heroku container registry
   ```bash
   heroku container:login
   ```
6. Update the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` variable in the Dockerfile.
   This should be the full URL of your Heroku app: i.e. "https://flask-react-aa.herokuapp.com"
7. Push your docker container to heroku from the root directory of your project.
   This will build the dockerfile and push the image to your heroku container registry
   ```bash
   heroku container:push web -a fruitfall
   ```
8. Release your docker container to heroku
   ```bash
   heroku container:release web -a fruitfall
   ```
9. set up your database:
   ```bash
   heroku run -a fruitfall python -m database
   ```
10. Under Settings find "Config Vars" and add any additional/secret .env variables.
